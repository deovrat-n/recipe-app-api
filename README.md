Docker Hub

Docker Hub is a cloud-based container registry that allows users to store, share, and access Docker images. It offers public and private repositories, official and community-contributed images, automated builds, webhooks, and image versioning. Users can push, pull, and search for images via the Docker CLI or web interface, making it a valuable tool for development, testing, and deploying containerized applications.


GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions is a CI/CD platform that automates workflows directly in GitHub. It triggers tasks (e.g., testing, building, deploying) based on events like push or pull_request. Workflows are defined in YAML files and consist of jobs and steps, which can use reusable actions from the GitHub Marketplace. Key features include parallel jobs, matrix builds, and deep GitHub integration. Itâ€™s commonly used for automated testing, deployment, and code quality checks.

Linting

Linting is the automated process of analyzing code to detect errors, enforce coding standards, and promote best practices. Tools like ESLint (JavaScript), Pylint (Python), and Stylelint (CSS) provide early feedback, improve code quality, and ensure consistency in projects. Linters can be customized for specific guidelines and are essential for maintaining readable, error-free code.
